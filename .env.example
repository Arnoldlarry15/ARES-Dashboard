# Google Gemini API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
# The dashboard works without an API key using mock data

# For Vercel deployment, add this to your Vercel project environment variables:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# (Note: no VITE_ prefix - this is for the backend API only)

# For local development with Vercel CLI (optional):
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Frontend environment variables (these are exposed to the browser)
# Only use for non-sensitive configuration
# VITE_APP_NAME=ARES Dashboard
# VITE_API_URL=/api

# Production Notes:
# - Never commit .env.local to git
# - Use Vercel Environment Variables for production secrets
# - Backend API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY) are NOT exposed to the frontend
# - Frontend variables with VITE_ prefix ARE exposed to the browser
